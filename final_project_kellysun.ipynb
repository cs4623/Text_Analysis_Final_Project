        "\n",
        "For the final project in *Intro to Text Analysis in Python*, I examine how the Biden administration talks about the “middle class” and “tax fairness.” Both phrases appear constantly in American politics, but it is not always clear what they mean in practice. My research question is: **How does the White House frame the “middle class / working families” compared to “tax fairness and the wealthy” in official economic statements?** Using web-scraped Briefing Room statements and a small toolkit of text-analysis methods, I compare the vocabulary, tone, and named actors associated with each frame.\n"

        "## Data Collection and Corpus\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset comes from the White House archives of “Statements & Releases.” Using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, I scraped the archive and extracted the title, date, URL, and main article text for **200** Briefing Room statements (The White House, n.d.). After filtering for economic and tax-related content, the final analysis subset `econ_df` contains **46** statements with at least one of the two frames. I kept only English-language items and stored them in a pandas DataFrame called `df`. To keep the project reproducible, all scraping, cleaning, and analysis steps are written as code in the notebook `finalproject_whitehouse_framing.ipynb`, which is hosted in a GitHub repository (link provided with my submission). Anyone can rerun the notebook to rebuild the same corpus I use here.\n",
        "\n",
        "From this raw corpus, I then built an analysis subset focused on economic and tax topics. First, I defined two sets of framing keywords. The **middle-class / working-families** set includes phrases such as “middle class,” “working families,” “family budget,” and “cost of living.” The **tax-fairness / wealthy** set includes “tax,” “fair share,” “billionaires,” “wealthiest,” and “loopholes.” Using helper functions, I tagged each statement with two Boolean columns, `middle_class_frame` and `tax_fairness_frame`, depending on whether the lower-cased text contained at least one keyword. Because many Briefing Room items discuss multiple policy areas, I also wrote a function to extract only the sentences that contain any framing keyword. This produced a `filtered_text` column that narrows the analysis to the parts of each statement where the middle class or tax fairness is explicitly invoked. Finally, I constructed `econ_df`, which keeps only statements that hit at least one frame and have non-empty `filtered_text`. This is the subset used for the rest of the analysis.\n"

        "## Text-Analysis Methods and TF–IDF Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "To compare language across frames, I concatenated the filtered text of all middle-class statements into one corpus and did the same for the tax-fairness statements. Before computing TF–IDF, I cleaned the text by lower-casing, removing non-alphabetic characters, dropping standard English stopwords, and removing high-frequency White House boilerplate words such as “president,” “white house,” “statement,” and “fact sheet.” I then applied `TfidfVectorizer` with unigrams and bigrams (`ngram_range=(1, 2)`, `min_df=2`), which assigns each word or phrase a score based on how distinctive it is for that frame (Pedregosa et al., 2011). To visualize the results, I calculated the difference in TF–IDF scores between frames and plotted the top bigrams for each group in a side-by-side bar chart.\n",
        "\n",
        "The TF–IDF results suggest that the two frames organize political language at different levels. In the **Middle Class / Working Families** corpus, the most distinctive bigrams cluster around everyday security and care: phrases such as “child care,” “economic security,” and “higher education” connect the middle class to concrete household protections and opportunities. In contrast, the **Tax Fairness / Wealthy** corpus highlights instruments and powerful actors: bigrams such as “tax credits,” “tax cuts,” and “cut billionaires” present economic policy as a tool for reshaping who pays and how resources are allocated. Taken together, these patterns show that the same “middle class” constituency appears in two stories: one about stabilizing fragile day-to-day wellbeing, and another about structural fairness and shifting the tax burden at the top.\n"

        "## Sentiment and Named-Entity Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "To get a sense of tone, I complemented the TF–IDF analysis with sentiment scoring. Using the VADER `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer`, I computed a compound sentiment score for each statement’s `filtered_text` (Hutto & Gilbert, 2014). The average score is **0.64** for middle-class / working-families statements and **0.53** for tax-fairness / wealthy statements. Both values are clearly above zero, which fits the genre of official presidential communication that tends to remain positive and forward-looking even when describing problems. The gap between the two frames is noticeable but not huge: middle-class messages are framed in somewhat more upbeat, reassuring language, while tax-fairness messages, although still positive on average, more often combine praise with calls for change in who pays and how the system should be rebalanced.\n",
        "\n",
        "I also experimented with named-entity recognition (NER) using spaCy (spaCy, n.d.). Applying NER to the filtered sentences and keeping only people, organizations, places, and groups, I built simple frequency tables for each frame. In the middle-class / working-families frame, the entities that show up disproportionately often are tied to national identity and the administration itself: the words “American,” “Americans,” “America,” and “U.S.,” as well as names like “Biden,” “Harris,” “Medicare,” and “the Biden-Harris Administration.” In other words, talk about the middle class is closely linked to “ordinary Americans” and to the current administration as the actor providing benefits, especially through Medicare.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the tax-fairness frame, by contrast, the small set of entities that are more frequent are explicit political or industry targets: “Republicans,” “Big Oil,” “Trump,” and individual legislators such as “Frank Pallone.” These names appear only or mainly in tax-fairness-tagged sentences in this sample, and rarely in the middle-class context. This pattern suggests that when the White House talks about the middle class it foregrounds a broad national community and its own governing role, whereas tax-fairness language is more likely to single out specific actors who should change their behavior or pay more. NER therefore adds a “who” dimension that complements the “what” captured by the TF–IDF bigram comparison.\n"

        "\n",
        "There are several limitations to this project. The dataset covers only a slice of the White House archive and only one administration, so the findings cannot be generalized to all U.S. political communication. My framing labels depend on simple keyword lists and may miss more subtle or ironic uses of “middle class” or “tax” language. TF–IDF treats all documents as equally important and ignores word order beyond bigrams, and VADER’s lexicon-based approach may underestimate the complexity of policy rhetoric. Going forward, it would be valuable to extend the corpus to more years and to compare across administrations, or to use contextual embeddings to detect frames without pre-defined keyword lists.\n"

By combining scraping, TF–IDF, sentiment analysis, and NER, I am able to trace how the Biden White House uses the “middle class” both as a vulnerable group needing concrete protections and as a moral reference point for justifying changes to the tax system.

These trickle-down economic policies left behind too many communities across the country. Infrastructure deteriorated, manufacturers shipped jobs abroad, economic opportunity dwindled, and regional inequality grew. China\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s unfair trade practices further undermined American manufacturers and workers in industrial communities. President Biden came into office with a new vision and promised to invest in every community across the country, particularly left-behind communities, such as economically distressed areas, factory towns, and coal communities. Over the past four years, in every piece of economic legislation, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked tirelessly to deliver a surge in resources and supports to local leaders, workers, and businesses, enabling communities to turn setback into comeback. In the first three years of the Biden-Harris Administration, left-behind counties experienced their strongest three-year period of job creation and business growth since the turn of the century, growing four times faster per year than under the first three years of the previous administration. To cement this legacy and drive continued progress for communities across the country, today, President Biden will sign a new Executive Order to help left-behind communities make a comeback. The Executive Order follows the Department of Commerce\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s recent announcement of $235 in new awards for critical regional economic development initiatives and the re-authorization of the Economic Development Administration. EXECUTIVE ORDER ON HELPING LEFT-BEHIND COMMUNITIES MAKE A COMEBACK Today, President Biden will sign his landmark Executive Order on Helping Left-Behind Communities Make a Comeback, which will help ensure that the federal government continues to direct investments and resources to left-behind and distressed communities that deserve renewed economic opportunity. Specifically, this Executive Order: Prioritizes left-behind communities for economic development funding opportunities. The Order prioritizes communities facing economic distress, undergoing industrial transitions, emerging as innovation hubs, and rebuilding from natural disasters. Directs whole-of-government coordination of federal investments in left-behind communities that are receiving multiple economic development awards. The Order encourages agencies to work directly with communities on a cohesive strategy to improve local economic conditions. Establishes a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cNo Wrong Door\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d approach. This Order directs federal agencies to identify and guide communities to economic development resources in other federal agencies, including technical assistance programs and offices. This approach is critical so individuals and communities do not have to navigate the complicated maze of different agencies. Economically distressed communities often have limited capacity to identify federal grant funding.\\u00c2 Strengthens resilience in disaster prone and affected communities. The Order directs federal agency field staff in areas that have recently suffered from natural disasters to identify funding opportunities to address long-term economic development, infrastructure, and resiliency needs. ANNOUNCING $235 MILLION IN NEW AWARDS Earlier this week, the Biden-Harris Administration announced a total of $235 million in new awards to support critical regional economic development initiatives. The Department of Commerce\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Economic Development Administration announced $210 million across six new awards under the flagship Tech Hubs program, bringing the total amount of Tech Hubs funding announced to date to over $700 million. The Tech Hubs program invests in regions across the country that have the assets to become globally competitive in industries of the future, strengthening national and economic security while ensuring the benefits of innovation reach communities all across America. Tech Hubs awards fund consortia with public, private, and academic partners. The awards will support: American Aerospace Materials Manufacturing Tech Hub (WA) \\u2013 $48 million: Led by American Aerospace Materials Manufacturing Center, this Tech Hub aims to develop new domestic supply chains to meet the immediate demand for high-rate production of advanced composite aerostructures in defense and commercial markets. Corvallis Microfluidics Tech Hub (OR) \\u2013 $45 million: Led by Oregon State University, this Tech Hub aims to establish global leadership in the development, scaling, and commercialization of microfluidics technology for use in semiconductor cooling, continuous flow processing, and biotechnology. Birmingham Biotechnology Hub (AL) \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 $44 million: Led by Southern Research Institute, this Tech Hub aims to become a global leader in drug, vaccine, and diagnostics development by applying artificial intelligence (AI)-driven biotechnology to increase diverse representation in clinical genomic data and clinical trials. Critical Minerals and Materials for Advanced Energy (CM2AE) Tech Hub (MO) \\u2013 $28 million: Led by the University of Missouri System, this Tech Hub aims to position south-central Missouri as a global leader in critical minerals processing to provide the materials needed to support battery technology. Vermont Gallium Nitride Tech Hub (VT) \\u2013 $24 million: Led by the University of Vermont, this Tech Hub seeks to accelerate the development and adoption of high power, high frequency electronic devices using Gallium Nitride (GaN)-based semiconductor chips. Forest Bioproducts Advanced Manufacturing Tech Hub (ME) \\u2013 $22 million: Led by the Maine Technology Institute, this Tech Hub aims to become a global leader in forest-based biomaterial production and manufacturing by extracting biological building blocks from forests, manipulating them for use, and manufacturing environmentally sustainable products from those components. The Economic Development Administration also awarded a total of $25 million across eight awards under the Good Jobs Challenge to support high-quality, locally led workforce training programs that lead to workers placed into good jobs. These new awards expand EDA\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Good Jobs Challenge portfolio to 35 states and one territory and increase the portfolio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s overall job placements target to 53,000. PRESIDENT BIDEN\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099S RECORD OF INVESTING IN LEFT-BEHIND COMMUNITIES This Executive Order and $235 million in new awards build on four years of actions taken by the Biden-Harris Administration to invest in left-behind communities. Supporting communities through industrial transitions: The Biden-Harris Administration\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Investing in America agenda is mobilizing historic levels of private sector investment in the United States, bringing manufacturing back to America, and creating good-paying jobs. President Biden is committed to ensuring that these new private sector investments flow to communities that are undergoing industrial transitions and have faced prior job losses in the manufacturing and energy sectors. In February 2021, President Biden established the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization (Energy Communities IWG) to deliver resources to the coal, oil and gas, and power plant communities that have powered our country for generations but faced increasing unemployment and economic distress in recent decades. The Energy Communities IWG is helping local leaders in Energy Communities create good-paying jobs, spur economic revitalization, remediate environmental degradation, and support energy workers. Key accomplishments of the Energy Communities IWG include: Awarding over $54 billion in federal investments to Energy Communities, such as the $4 billion set aside in Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for clean energy manufacturing investments in Energy Communities; Catalyzing $315 billion in announced job-creating private sector investments in clean energy and manufacturing; Launching Rapid Response Teams to provide on-the-ground assistance to local leaders in the Energy Communities that have faced the most significant declines in economic opportunity; and Forging a partnership with AmeriCorps to place 150 full-time AmeriCorps members in nine federally designated Energy Communities. President Biden has made strategic investments to ensure that the future of the global auto industry is made in historic American auto communities by American workers. For example, the Biden-Harris Administration announced over $1 billion in financing to support small- and medium-sized auto suppliers, a $52 million grant to the Detroit Regional Partnership to unite around and implement a common vision for Detroit\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s legacy automotive industry, billions of dollars in awards to support new electric vehicle and battery materials manufacturing sites in the American Midwest, and new workforce development initiatives to prepare workers for these good-paying jobs. Helping economically distressed regions turn setback into comeback: The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes that distressed communities suffering from a downward spiral of disinvestment may not have the capacity to access the Biden-Harris Administration\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s historic investments. President Biden has launched and expanded programs to equip distressed communities with the resources they need to make a comeback , including: Regional Commissions \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law: Structured as federal-state partnerships servicing different regions of the country, Regional Commissions make place-based investments in technical assistance, capacity building, economic development, workforce, and infrastructure. President Biden\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law appropriated the six Regional Commissions over $1 billion in additional funding to help local economies and distressed communities attract historic public and private investments in manufacturing, infrastructure, and clean energy. President Biden also secured the authorization of the Great Lakes Authority, which, once operational, will serve the Midwest. Good Jobs Challenge \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 American Rescue Plan: The Good Jobs Challenge is a $525 million program supporting 40 regional, industry-led workforce training systems that will \\u00c2\\u00a0\\u00c2\\u00a0\\u00c2\\u00a0\\u00c2\\u00a0\\u00c2\\u00a0place a total of 50,000 workers into good jobs, helping to accelerate local economic growth and rebuild resilient regional economies. The program places an emphasis on supporting historically underserved populations and distressed communities, including rural, urban-core, disaster-impacted, and coal communities. Most awardees are leveraging the funding to offer flexible workforce solutions such as technology or language support, affordable childcare, and transportation services. Recompete Pilot Program (\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cRecompete\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d) \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 CHIPS & Science Act: Recompete is investing in six distressed communities across the country to support innovative strategies to create good-paying jobs and stimulate local economic growth. These awards are supporting workforce training, wraparound services, critical infrastructure, entrepreneurship, and small business creation. The Rural Partners Network: This is a whole-of-government initiative that sends federal staff to 25 rural communities across the country. Rural communities such as the Tri-County North Delta, which borders the Mississippi River, are getting help accessing federal resources through local federal offices or federal partnerships with the local chamber of commerce, higher-education institutions, philanthropies, and workforce development organizations. Investing in innovation in places across the country: Before President Biden came to office, innovation had begun to concentrate on the coasts of our country. From 2005 to 2017, just five metro areas represented more than 90 percent of the nation\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s innovation-sector growth. This left entire regions out of a critical driver of economic development and put America at a disadvantage by failing to invest in the talent and ideas that are located across the country. The President\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s innovation and manufacturing programs target places that have been overlooked for too long \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 including rural communities, Energy Communities, and employment distressed regions. The Biden-Harris Administration has pursued a consortia-based approach to investing in innovation in regions across the country, which equips community leaders with competitively awarded federal funding to implement locally tailored solutions. Consortia of businesses, local governments, academic institutions, non-profit organizations, and labor are implementing projects to stimulate innovation and economic growth such as developing workforce training, building new laboratories, and incubating startups. These consortia-based innovation programs include: Build Back Better Regional Challenge (BBBRC) \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 American Rescue Plan: BBBRC awarded $1 billion to 21 coalitions to transform their regional economies by growing a particular local industry \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 including transportation, agriculture, and advanced manufacturing. To grow these critical industries, awardees are investing in workforce training, wraparound services, industrial site redevelopment, and small business incubators and accelerators. Two years into the five-year implementation period, these 21 regional coalitions have catalyzed $2.2 billion in local private investment, generated 1,300 new jobs, and helped create 275 new businesses. Regional Technology & Innovation Hubs Program (\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cTech Hubs\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d) \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 CHIPS & Science Act: The Tech Hubs program is investing in regions across the country that have the assets necessary to become globally competitive hubs in industries of the future \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 strengthening U.S. economic and national security, while ensuring that innovation helps drive economic growth in communities across America. This program designated 31 Tech Hubs that consist of consortia with public, private, and academic partners, 18 of which received large-scale implementation grants totaling more than $700 million. Over one-third of awardees serve small and rural communities. Regional Innovation Engines Program (\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cNSF Engines\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d) \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 CHIPS & Science Act: NSF Engines is investing at least $200 million in ten regional innovation initiatives across the country. The funding is focused on places that have not fully benefitted from technology-driven economic growth over the past decades. Each awardee is leveraging their private, public, and nonprofit sectors to research solutions and train their workforce for key sectors such as energy storage, regenerative medicine, and textile manufacturing innovation. Microelectronics Commons (\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cME Commons\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d) \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 CHIPS & Science Act: ME Commons is designed to advance America\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s microelectronics capabilities through a collaborative national network of innovation hubs. ###\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We, as a nation, must affirm and protect women\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s full equality once and for all. On January 27, 2020, the Commonwealth of Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. The American Bar Association (ABA) has recognized that the Equal Rights Amendment has cleared all necessary hurdles to be formally added to the Constitution as the 28th Amendment. I agree with the ABA and with leading legal constitutional scholars that the Equal Rights Amendment has become part of our Constitution. It is long past time to recognize the will of the American people. In keeping with my oath and duty to Constitution and country, I affirm what I believe and what three-fourths of the states have ratified: the 28th Amendment is the law of the land, guaranteeing all Americans equal rights and protections under the law regardless of their sex. ###\",\n          \"January 15, 2025 Statement from Vice President Kamala Harris Home Briefing Room Statements and Releases Thanks to the leadership of President Joe Biden, a ceasefire and hostage deal has been reached between Israel and Hamas. I thank the mediators \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Emir al-Thani of Qatar and President el-Sisi of Egypt \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 and I am grateful for the work of U.S. officials whose diligent diplomacy allowed us to arrive at this significant moment. Doug and I pray for all the hostages, and we are grateful that some, including Americans, will soon be reunited with their loved ones. In my meetings with the families of American hostages, I vowed they will never be in this fight alone. President Biden and I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans, and are determined that all the American hostages be returned home as part of this deal. We will never forget the lives taken as a result of the brutal Hamas terrorist attack on October 7, and the horrors endured by countless innocent people in the war that followed. In my many conversations with leaders in the region, my unwavering focus has been to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and\\u00a0self-determination. Today\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s agreement will begin to bring desperately needed relief to the people of Gaza through a surge in humanitarian aid and an end to the fighting. While there is more work to be done, I believe this agreement can be the foundation on which we build toward a two-state solution that creates a more peaceful future for Israeli and Palestinian people. I will never stop working to achieve a future of greater peace, dignity, and security for all people in the region. # # #\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "- **Tax Fairness / Wealthy** framing leans toward system-level instruments and elite actors: bigrams such as *“tax credits”*, *“tax cuts”*, *“accelerated pathway”*, and *“cut billionaires”* present policy as a tool for reshaping who pays and how resources are allocated.\n",

Supporting communities through industrial transitions: The Biden-Harris Administration\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Investing in America agenda is mobilizing historic levels of private sector investment in the United States, bringing manufacturing back to America, and creating good-paying jobs. The Energy Communities IWG is helping local leaders in Energy Communities create good-paying jobs, spur economic revitalization, remediate environmental degradation, and support energy workers. Key accomplishments of the Energy Communities IWG include: Awarding over $54 billion in federal investments to Energy Communities, such as the $4 billion set aside in Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for clean energy manufacturing investments in Energy Communities; Catalyzing $315 billion in announced job-creating private sector investments in clean energy and manufacturing; Launching Rapid Response Teams to provide on-the-ground assistance to local leaders in the Energy Communities that have faced the most significant declines in economic opportunity; and Forging a partnership with AmeriCorps to place 150 full-time AmeriCorps members in nine federally designated Energy Communities. For example, the Biden-Harris Administration announced over $1 billion in financing to support small- and medium-sized auto suppliers, a $52 million grant to the Detroit Regional Partnership to unite around and implement a common vision for Detroit\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s legacy automotive industry, billions of dollars in awards to support new electric vehicle and battery materials manufacturing sites in the American Midwest, and new workforce development initiatives to prepare workers for these good-paying jobs.
